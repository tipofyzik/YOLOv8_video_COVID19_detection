## Datasets
For this project two datasets were used:
1. Face mask detection dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
2. Custom dataset to work with the mentioned above. It includes **mask_data.yaml** file that is required for working with face mask detection dataset and two images for testing. Just fownload files from **mask_data** folder, create your custom dataset on Kaggle, and add these files there. I named my custom dataset **mask_data**.
